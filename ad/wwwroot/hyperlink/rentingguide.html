        <li class="heading">Getting the Price Right:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A tenant should not spend more than 25-30% of the household income on rent. After all, apart from the monthly rental amount, one needs to pay maintenance cost, water and electricity bills, oftentimes some top-up charges and a hefty one-time deposit. If one has used an agent for finding the rental property, one will also need to pay a month's rent amount as brokerage.</li>
        </ul>
        <li class="heading">Nailing the Accessibility Factor:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                One of the most attractive advantages that renting instead of buying a home is that one gets a wide choice of locations, and flexibility to relocate if one property doesn't work out as well as hoped.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <li class="heading">Thorough Research:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The tech-savvy correctly assume that the ability to scout for rental properties online takes a lot of the sting out of the rental housing hunt. In fact, there is any number of realty portals that list rental options in a given locality. Some are posted directly by owners, but most by brokers.</li>
        </ul>
        <li class="heading">Good Resale Value:</li>
        <ul>
            <li> Resale sale Value is an important thing to consider before you plan to invest or buy a property. Property buyers never consider resale value when they buy. They make the mistake of focusing solely on a prime locality or the budget of the property. If you choose the wrong property or location, it is possible that your future sales price will always be less than the other homes around it.</li>
        </ul>
        <li class="heading">Vetting Rental Properties :</li>
        <ul>
            <li> Once the search is over, one must take out time to personally visit the shortlisted properties. The main external factor to focus on is whether social infrastructure facilities like daily-needs shopping outlets, entertainment options, hospitals, etc. are within easy reach. If not, day-to-day life becomes difficult.</li>
        </ul>
        <li class="heading">The All-Important Rental Agreement:</li>
        <ul>
            <li> Though the rental agreement is the last piece in the puzzle, it can be the most critical aspect of finally securing the right rental property and living in the aspired-for comfort and assurance. After negotiating the price, one must read the rental contract details carefully, from a legal standpoint.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
