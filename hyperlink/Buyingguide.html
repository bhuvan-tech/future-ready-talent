        <ul>

        </ul>
        <li class="heading">Loan eligibility:</li>
        <ul>
            <li> Home loan eligibility depends upon the repayment capacity, income, existing loans or debts and age of the loan applicant. The lending company or banks provide online services such as home loan eligibility calculator to calculate loan eligibility of the home loan borrower. The maximum loan that can be sanctioned varies with the banks and the eligibility criteria may vary according to the bank or RBI regulations. As home loan rates increase, the loan eligibility for a borrower becomes stiffer.</li>

        <ul>
            <li> This is an important expense or tax, much like the sales tax and income tax that are collected by the Government. When planning your budget for property buying and deciding to buy a property, you need to know the rate and charges applicable in your city.

Find out the stamp duty amount applicable to you as per the market value.</li>
