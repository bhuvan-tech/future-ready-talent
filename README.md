# Azure Active Directory
  Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based identity and access management service. We have used to AAD to authenticate user into our website. With the use of AAD, we don't need to maintain a Database-management-system. We have created this using ASP.net and deployed in the azure.

# Azure App Service
   Azure App Service supports various versions of .NET apps, and provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service. ASP.NET web apps are cross-platform and can be hosted on Linux or Windows. When you're finished, you'll have an Azure resource group consisting of an App Service hosting plan and an App Service with a deployed web application. We hosted web-app using Azure App Service because it is easy to deploy and publish.

 #  Azure Bot Service
    Azure Bot Service is a enterprise-grade, natural conversation converter which used to give responses for a particular question. We have created a bot which used to solve the customer question.
